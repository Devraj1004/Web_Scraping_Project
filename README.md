🚀 From Wall Street to Web Scraping
Analyzing Tesla & GameStop Stock Trends with Python

"In the stock market, trends tell stories — we’re here to listen, decode, and visualize them."

📖 Overview

This project is a data-driven journey into the world of Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) — two companies that have dominated headlines for very different reasons.
We combine real-time market data from Yahoo Finance with revenue history scraped from Macrotrends, then use Python to clean, analyze, and visualize the results.

Whether it’s Tesla’s electric surge or GameStop’s meme-fueled rocket ride, this notebook uncovers the numbers behind the news. 📊
